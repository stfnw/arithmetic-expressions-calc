Exploring various kinds of program execution like

  - interpreter
  - VM (virtual machine)
  - JIT (just-in-time) compiler
  - AOT (ahead-of-time) compiler

with arithmetic expressions as an example.

# Usage

```
calc [interpret | vm | jit | compile outfile] expr
```

`expr` is an arithmetic expression.
The program only supports signed 64 bit integers, and the operations addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
Expressions can be explicitly grouped using parenthesis;
but operators also follow the usual precedence rules regarding unary minus, multiplication / division, and addition / subtraction.

# Tests

```
./calc test
```

This computes the result for some pre-generated random arithmetic instructions using each implemented method and asserts that all methods agree with each other on the expression value.
